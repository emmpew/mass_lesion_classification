# Mass Lession Classification â€” Predicting whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant

The project will focus on mammography which is considered the most effective method for detecting breast cancer. The problem is that the low positive predictive value of breast
biopsy resulting from mammogram interpretation leads to approximately
70% unnecessary biopsies with benign outcomes.

Physicians and hospitals around the world can use such a model to predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant. Patients can have a better diagnosis and avoid unnecessary biopsies. Better predictions can help both the physician and patient to reduce costs in case of negligence due to unnecessary expenses or lawsuits due to wrong diagnosis.

The Mammographic Mass Data Set has been acquired from the UCI repository. This data contains 961 instances of masses detected in mammograms, and contains the following attributes:

1.    BI-RADS assessment: 1 to 5 (ordinal)
2.    Age: patient's age in years (integer)
3.    Shape: mass shape: round=1 oval=2 lobular=3 irregular=4 (nominal)
4.    Margin: mass margin: circumscribed=1 microlobulated=2 obscured=3 ill-defined=4 spiculated=5 (nominal)
5.    Density: mass density high=1 iso=2 low=3 fat-containing=4 (ordinal)
6.    Severity: benign=0 or malignant=1 (binominal)
